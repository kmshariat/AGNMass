# Comparaing AGN Masses from the Spectral Data from NED Archive

An Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) has a Broad Line Region [BLR] and a Narrow Line Region [NLR]. In this way to determine the mass of the AGN, we are using the cgs unit system [Centimeter Gram Second].To determine the mass of the AGN, we will mainly focus on the BLR. 
Using Newtonian Mechanics we get the mass of the AGN to be:

$M = fRv^{2}/G$

For a spherical distribution, f = 3/4.
